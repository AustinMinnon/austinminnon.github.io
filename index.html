            After graduating high school I found myself searching for a legitimate career.
            Wise peers recommended staying in school. My parents reassured me that school would pay off, but juggling work and school was difficult. I began a full time cook job that would support me for two years. Excelling quickly made me a team favorite, but i was overworked and underpaid. I moved out of my parents house after turning 20. Cooking full time had worn me out, and i wasn't where i wanted to be. Halfway to my associates degree is when i took a step back.

            I wanted to get into a computer based career back in high school, but lost my drive. I knew that a bold move would get me out of the kitchen and possibly into an exciting career field working with computers. A close friend of mine had told me to check out Epicodus. Based on the value, and knowledge at stake, I decided to travel with this friend and study. 48 hours of driving later, here i am with an open mind.
