        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          After graduating high school I found myself searching for a legitimate career. I had no experience going into a job that would support me for two years. excelling quickly made me a manager's favorite, but i was overworked and underpaid. Cooking full time had worn me out, and i wasn't where i wanted to be.

          I wanted to get into a computer based career back in high school, but lost my drive. I knew that a bold move would get me out of the kitchen and possibly into an exciting career field working with computers. A close friend of mine told me to check out Epicodus. Based on the value, and knowledge at stake, I decided to travel with this friend and study. 48 hours of driving later, i am here with an open mind.
